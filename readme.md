# Growth Hub Landing Page

Welcome to the Growth Hub landing page project! This is a part of my endeavor to create a professional website for my SaaS company, Growth Hub.

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to designing and developing a landing page for my SaaS (Software as a Service) company. Unlike using external frameworks or libraries, this landing page is crafted with pure HTML and CSS, showcasing a clean and minimalistic design. Additionally, I've incorporated a touch of JavaScript to enhance user experience, including features like the responsive hamburger menu and a dynamic FAQ accordion.

## Project Preview

To give you a glimpse of what I've created, here's a preview of my landing page:
